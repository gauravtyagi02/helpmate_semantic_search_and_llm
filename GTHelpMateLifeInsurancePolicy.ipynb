      "\n",
      "To determine the amount needed to purchase the policy, the following points can be derived from the provided text: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. The maximum amount that can be purchased for an individual policy varies based on the circumstances of termination: \n",
      "\n",
      "   - If termination falls under specific conditions, the maximum amount will be the Member Life Insurance benefit in force on the termination date, less any individual policy amount purchased earlier and any Accelerated Benefit payment. \n",
      "\n",
      "   - In other termination scenarios, the maximum amount may be capped at $10,000 or the Member Life Insurance benefit in force on the termination date, less any Accelerated Benefit payment and less the amount eligible under any group policy within 31 days. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. For Dependent Life Insurance, an individual policy can be purchased without the need for Proof of Good Health, and it will only cover life insurance without additional benefits. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. In the event of a Member's death within the 31-day individual purchase period, the beneficiary will receive the individual policy amount that the Member had the right to purchase, upon providing written proof of the Member's death. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Premium amounts for different types of insurance policies are determined based on the total volume of insurance in force divided by 1,000, multiplied by the premium rate in effect. \n",

The maximum amount that can be purchased is dependent on the Member Life Insurance benefit, with specific conditions outlined in the policy document.
